    <p><strong> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</strong>
    And <em>sorry</em> I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
    
    <p><strong>Then took the other, as just as fair,</strong>
    And having <em> perhaps</em> the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,</p>
    
    <p><strong>And both that morning equally lay</strong>
    In <em>leaves</em> no step had trodden black.
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
