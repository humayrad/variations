<p>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN BY ROBERT FROST</p> 
<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood</p>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
And then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy<br>
And wanted wear; though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same,
