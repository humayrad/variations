             <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>
<body>
    <p>two roads diverged in a yellow wood<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;and sorry i could not travel both<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be one traveler, long i stood<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and looked down one as far as i could<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;though as for that the passing there<br>
        had worn them really about the same,<br>
