               <p><div>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                And sorry I could not travel both<br></div></p>
                And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                <br>
                <p><div>Then took the other, as just as fair,</div></p><br>
                <p><div>And having perhaps the better claim,</div><br>
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                Though as for that the passing there<br>
                Had worn them really about the same,<br></p>
            </body>
