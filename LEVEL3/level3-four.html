            <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
            <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>

<p><float>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br></float>
                    And <div class="tomato"><p>sorry</p></div>
                   <p>I could not travel both<br>
                    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                    To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
                    
                    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                    Though as for that the passing there<br>
                    Had worn them really about the same,<br>
                </p>
