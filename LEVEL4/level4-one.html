            <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
            <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>
              <p> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                <div class="tomato"><p>And</p></div> sorry I could not travel both
                <div class="tomato"><p>And</p></div> be one traveler, long I stood
                <div class="tomato"><p>And</p></div> looked down one as far as I could
                <div class="tomato"><p>To</p></div> where it bent in the undergrowth;
                
                Then took the other, as just as <div class="tomato"><p>fair,</p></div>
                And having perhaps the better <div class="tomato"><p>claim</p></div> 
                Because it was grassy and wanted <div class="tomato"><p>wear;</p></div> 
                Though as for that the passing <div class="tomato"><p>there</p></div> 
                Had worn them really about the <div class="tomato"><p>same,</p></div> 
            </p>
