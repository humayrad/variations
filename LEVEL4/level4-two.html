        <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
        <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>

       
        <em>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</em>
        <p> And sorry I could not travel both</p>
        <em> And be one traveler, long I stood</em>
        <p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>
        <em> To where it bent in the undergrowth;</em>
            
        <p> Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
        <em> And having perhaps the better claim,</em>
        <p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
        <em>Though as for that the passing there</em>
        <p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
