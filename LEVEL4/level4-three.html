        <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
        <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>

    
        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>
        <em>And sorry I could not travel both</em>
        <p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p>
        <em>And looked down one as far as I could</em>
        <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
            
        <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
        <em>And having perhaps the better claim,</em>
        <p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
        <em>Though as for that the passing there</em>
        <p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
